As I showed in a [previous article](/posts/gd-proj), my first game was essentially unfinished when I released it back in May 2024. Although I worked hard to make a final, playable product, I was unhappy with the results.

Therefore, I have decided to remaster my first game, changing the art direction, gameplay, and story pieces as I have no creative restrictions with this project anymore. I also decided to start the project again from scratch, as I did not feel like relearning the codebase which was extremely unorganized.

## Creating a new player controller

The old player controller was unfinished, and it was very hard to control. Instead of rewriting the original controller, I decided to create a new one.

The new player controller is able to jump. crouch, and sneak, and In the future I plan on adding climbing and others to really allow the player to explore the world as freely as possible.

While creating this player controller, I wasn't even focused on remastering Naturebound, I was more focused on creating a player controller for any future project. I had a few concepts on my mind, from a beat-em-up similar to Skylanders, or Hyrule Warriors, to a Portal-like grapple gun game, where the main character was a duck-like creature.

For the latter, I even created a player model (which wasn't very great), showing how I waa ready to start work on this concept.
