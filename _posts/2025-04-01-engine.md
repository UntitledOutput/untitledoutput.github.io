For about 3 years, I have been working on a game engine under the name Project Tomato. The engine has undergone many backend changes, from basic [OpenGL](), to [Vulkan](), and finally, to [bgfx]().

## Starting Out

While I have little to no screenshots of the engine at the start of development, I have some that show my growth throughout this development journey.

This screenshot shows my first attempts at implementing PBR (physically based rendering) using a tutorial on LearnOpenGL ([link to the tutorial](https://learnopengl.com/PBR/Theory))
